# BusCompanyDatabaseSystem
Our system, as the name suggests, is the website of a bus company. We designed a 
website that contains various information about a bus company according to the route and 
time preferred by normal users and corporate users. We also have a table in the background 
where we keep all the informations about users and buses. This is the general orientation of 
our system. In the remainder of the report, we will explain the details about our database.
We used PostgreSQL program while creating our database. We fully complied with the 
naming standards of the PostgreSQL program
